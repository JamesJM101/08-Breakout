Created a game of breakout.
You control a paddle with the mouse to hit a ball.
When the ball hits a tile or pirate ship they break and the score increases.
If the ball falls past the bottom you lose a life. You can then click the left mouse button to generate a new ball.
If you lose all three balls, a gameover screen appears.
